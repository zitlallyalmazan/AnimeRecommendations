# Overview

This is an attempt in creating a Data Analysis spreadsheet using Pandas in Visual Studio Code and Anaconda software. I will analyze a set of data of anime recommendations throughout different platforms to see which are the most watched and preferred among watchers currently and compare how these results changed over the past 10 years.  

Here is a link for where I obtained my anime recommendations data:

* [Anime Recommendation Database 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020/discussion)

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}
