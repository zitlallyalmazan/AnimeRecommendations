# Overview

This is an attempt in creating a Data Analysis spreadsheet using Pandas in Visual Studio Code and Anaconda software. I will analyze a set of data of anime recommendations throughout different platforms to see which are the most watched and preferred among watchers currently and compare how these results changed over the past 10 years.  

Here is a link for where I obtained my anime recommendations dataset:

# Data Analysis Results

* I had trouble using Pandas in Visual Code Studio. I had installed it thinking there weren't any problems but when I would try to run it, an error kept popping up
* After Visual Studio Code didn't work, I switched over to use Jupyter in Anaconda-Navigator but found that syncing it pretty difficult in syncing it with GitHub
* However, I was able to start using Anaconda by creating a Hello World program
* I hope to figure out what is happening with Pandas in Visual Studio Code but if not, I will continue to work on my project in Anaconda. I wasn't expecting for the installation of Pandas to be so difficult in figuring out

# Development Environment

* Git/Github
* Visual Code Studio
* Anaconda-Navigator
* Pandas
* Jupyter notebook

# Future Work

* Figure out why Pandas isn't working properly in Visual Code Studio
* Figure out why Jupyter in Anaconda isn't connecting properly with GitHub
* Find a different spreadsheet that'll work with Jupyter in Ananconda
